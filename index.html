    <h1>Rock Paper and Scissors</h1>
    <p>there was a young man named Jack who was known to be unbeatable at the game of Rock Paper Scissors. Jack was so confident in his abilities that he boasted to his friends that he could beat anyone, including a computer.</p>
    <p>a group of computer programmers overheard Jack's claims and decided to challenge him to a bet. They would create an artificial intelligence program that could play Rock Paper Scissors and Jack would face off against it in a best of five match. If Jack won, he would win a large sum of money, but if he lost, he would have to pay the programmers the same amount.</p>
